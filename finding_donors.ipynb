    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",

    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "   Well, I am not sure if SVM without parameter tuning would be a good model choice for this problem as the default Kernel is 'rbf' which requires tuning of gamma parameter to avoid overfitting and lengthy computational time to train the model. Without parameter tuning SVM can end up overfitting training data in this problem.\n",

    "**2. GaussianNB -** Gaussian Naive Bayes model is widely used in real-world setting where classifications are to be made on basis of keywords like web search results or detecting whether an e-mail is spam or ham based on its content.\n",

    "   Strength of Gaussian Naive Bayes - Main advantage of Naive Bayes model is its easy implementation and low cost of computation. So, it performs well when the features are independent as it is assumed in Naive Bayes algorithm and low cost of computation is required.\n",

Highest time was taken by Support Vector Machine for both training and testing on all every size of data. This was expected because the default Kernel for SVM is 'rbf' which has high computational cost. While, Gaussian Naive Bayes took the lowest time to train and test data as it's implementation is very simple and cost effective**\n",

    "**The working of ADABoost Classifier can be compared to a problem consisting set of questions in different domain, assigning each question to domain expert and combining their solutions to solve the problem. It combines the result of many weak learners to make strong model. In this problem, we have multiple features and one binary target/independant variable income. Initially, AdaBoost classifier will assign equal weights to each data point, it will then split the data such that highest possible points with income>50k will be on one side. Then, it will calculate error, that is, misclassified point which lies on either side and it will increase weights of that points upto an extent. Again, classifier will bisect points based on their weights and dependant variable(income) value. Hence, positive(income>50k) data points with higher weights will be on one side of points. Again, it will increase the weights of misclassified points and so on. This iteration of spliting the data and assigning weights is the process carried out by weak learner models. Each weak learner models will calculate classifier weight based on total number of misclassified points and total weight of data points. AdaBoost classifier will follow this iterations until it has tried enough weak learning models. Adaboost Classifier algorithm will then combine these weak learner models just by adding or subtracting the calculated classifier weights where they predicted data point to be positive(income>50k) or negative(income<=50k) repectively and create final classifier boundary to separate positive(income>50k) and negative(income<=50k) data points.**"

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "**Above graph shows five most important features that can predict if individual makes 50K or more. There are couple of differences in it from my choice of features based on intuition without EDA previously. Here, hour per week and education are two feature that I didn't picked as important features in predicting individual's income, instead, I choosed occupation and working class. I agree that education can be important and basic factor to judge the income of individual, but I am skeptical about importance of hours-per-week feature as many people with low salary can end up earning less than 50k working more HPW while individuals with high income can earn more than 50k by even working for less or equal HPW. But, this are the 5 most important features picked by model after performing statistical analysis based on distribution of data. Hence, it is unfair to select most important features purely based on intuition without EDA in any problem and it can lead to totally wrong assumptions.**"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

With reduced features, AdaBoost model is not taking some important dependancies and aspects of other features into consideration which can be significant in this problem. Although, AdaBoost model takes slightly more time in training model using all the features, but it can be overlooked by results that we are getting in considering them rather than picking only five most important features.**"
